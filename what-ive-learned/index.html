                    <p>In the months since October 25th, I've spent time reflecting on what went wrong and what I needed to change. The incident that day wasn't about Preksha—it was about my inability to handle stress and frustration in a mature, respectful way. Here are the specific lessons I've learned and the changes I've committed to:</p>
                </div>

                <ul class="learned-list">
                    <li>That one moment of anger can undo months of peace, and that perception often matters more than intent. I now understand that how something appears matters as much as what I meant.</li>
                    <li>To pause before reacting, especially when emotions are high. I've learned to take a breath, step back, and think before speaking. Words spoken in frustration can't be unsaid, and I've learned to choose my words more carefully.</li>
                    <li>That respect isn't just shown in good times—it's most important during disagreements. True respect is demonstrated when things are difficult, not when everything is easy.</li>
                    <li>To listen not just to respond, but to understand. Her feelings matter more than being right. I've learned that winning an argument means losing trust, and I choose trust over being right.</li>
                    <li>That family deserves to see the best version of me, not the version that emerges under stress. I've learned to manage my stress and emotions so that my behavior remains consistent, regardless of circumstances.</li>
                    <li>To communicate with calm and clarity, even when I'm exhausted or frustrated. I've practiced techniques for managing difficult conversations and maintaining respect even when emotions run high.</li>
                    <li>That growth isn't about perfection—it's about recognizing mistakes, committing to change, and demonstrating that commitment consistently. I'm not perfect, but I'm committed to being better every day.</li>
                </ul>
