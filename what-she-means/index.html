                    <p>After everything that happened, I want you to know that my feelings for Preksha haven't changed. If anything, the time apart and the reflection have only deepened my understanding of what she means to me and why this relationship matters.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-paragraph">
                    <p>Preksha isn't just someone I love—she's someone who has shown me what partnership means. Our relationship was built on real affection, not infatuation. It was steady and genuine, something both our families recognized as serious and potentially long-term. The values you've instilled in her—her strength, her gentleness, her ability to stand firm while remaining open—these are the qualities that make her who she is, and they're the qualities I admire most.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="pull-quote">
                    <p>"She's someone who makes you want to be better—not because she demands it, but because she inspires it."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-paragraph">
                    <p>What I've learned is that she deserves someone who can match her calm, who can handle difficult moments with the same grace she shows, and who can be trusted to be consistent—not just in good times, but especially when things are hard. More than anything, Preksha is someone I want to build a life with. Not because of what I imagine that life to be, but because of who she is: grounded, kind, and genuinely good. She's someone worth learning for, and someone worth becoming better for.</p>
