                        <p class="apology-text">I am deeply sorry for what happened on October 25th, 2024. I am sorry for the words I spoke in frustration, for raising my voice in front of you, and for the messages that followed. Most of all, I am sorry for the pain and concern this caused you and for the disappointment you felt seeing your daughter upset.</p>
                        <p class="apology-text">I take full responsibility for my actions. There is no excuse for how I behaved that day, and I understand why you made the decision you did on July 22nd, 2025. I am not here to make excuses or to justify what happened. I am here to express my genuine remorse and to show you who I am, and who I am committed to being.</p>

                    <div class="acknowledgment-text">
                        <p>I understand that from your perspective, what you witnessed that day—your daughter upset and words that seemed disrespectful—broke the image you had of a calm, stable relationship. You felt protective, disappointed, and even a little betrayed. To you, it didn't look like a momentary argument; it looked like a deeper problem.</p>
                        <p>Your feelings were completely understandable. You had only that day and those messages to judge from. What you couldn't see was the immediate remorse I felt, the conversations Preksha and I had afterward, or the months of reflection and growth that followed. But I don't expect you to believe that based on words alone. I know trust must be earned through actions, not words.</p>

                        <li>To always treat Preksha with respect, especially during disagreements. I will never raise my voice in anger or speak words in frustration that I cannot take back.</li>
                        <li>To communicate with calm and clarity, even when emotions run high. I will pause, breathe, and choose words that heal rather than hurt.</li>
                        <li>To listen actively and with empathy. Her feelings matter more than being right, and I will always prioritize understanding over winning an argument.</li>
                        <li>To respect your family values and traditions. Your daughter grew up in a home with values I admire, and I commit to honoring those in our life together.</li>
                        <li>To show you the best version of myself, not just in good times but consistently. I understand that trust is built in moments, not just in grand gestures.</li>
                        <li>To continue growing and learning. I am not perfect, but I am committed to becoming better each day—for Preksha, for myself, and for your family.</li>

                        <p>I want to be part of your family not because it's convenient or expected, but because I've seen the values you've instilled in Preksha. She's grounded, respectful, and genuinely good—qualities that reflect the home she came from. I want to learn from those values and contribute to them.</p>
                        <p>More than that, I want to earn your trust. Not through words written here, but through consistent actions over time. I want to show you that I'm someone who can be relied upon, who can be trusted with your daughter's happiness, and who can be welcomed into your family with confidence.</p>
                        <p>If someday you choose to see me again, I'll be grateful for the chance to earn your trust—not just for a day, but for a lifetime.</p>
